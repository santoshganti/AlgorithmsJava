 * It's a complete tree except possibly the last level and even in that last level. All the keys are as left as possible.

 * This property of the binary heap makes them suitable to be store in an array
 *
 * Min Heap - the key at the root must be minimum among all the keys present in the binary heap. This must be
 * true for all the keys present in the binary heap.
 *
 * Max Heap - the key at the root must be the max among all the keys present in the binary tree. This must be recursively
 * true for all the keys in the binary heap.
